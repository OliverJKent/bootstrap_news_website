        <h2>Nvidia Says the RTX 2080 is up to 50 Percent Faster than the 1080 in Regular Games</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Nvidia unveiled its new RTX 2080 earlier this week, but the company primarily focused on performance improvements for its new ray tracing support. That left many wondering just how big the performance gains will be for the vast majority of existing games that won’t be updated to support ray tracing. With preorders already live, Nvidia is now revealing that there will be some noticeable gains from a GTX 1080 to the new RTX 2080.</p>

          <h2>Intel Working on New Discrete GPUs, Codenamed Arctic Sound</h2>
          <br>
          <p>When Intel hired Raja Koduri last year, it was clear the company was serious about graphics. Koduri has spent much of his professional career in graphics for AMD and ATI; bringing him on-board was a signal that Intel intended to invest into GPUs more aggressively than it had done before. Intel’s Arctic Sound reportedly began life as a video streaming app processor intended for data centers before being repurposed by Raja as a full-on discrete GPU.</p>

          <h2>HyperX extends its Predator DDR4 memory kits to 128GB</h2>
          <br>
          <p>Most users don't need 128GB of RAM, at least not right now. But for those relatively select few who do (and those who simply want more system memory), HyperX is now happy to oblige with its Predator DDR4 memory. HyperX is expanding both the speeds and capacities of its Predator DDR4 RGB and regular Predator DDR4 memory kits. </p>
